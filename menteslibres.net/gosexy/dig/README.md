# gosexy/dig

This package provides sugar methods for traversing Go maps.

`gosexy/dig` basically turns this long statement:

```go
foo := myMap["a"].(map[string]interface{})["b"].(map[string]interface{})["c"].(uint64)
```

Into this short and easier-to-understand one:

```go
foo := dig.Uint64(myMap, "a", "b", "c")
```

Useful when you depend on external services, such as web-APIs, and you don't
really want to handle all possible error cases or possible panic points caused
by sudden changes on the expected JSON.

## Installation

```
go get -u menteslibres.net/gosexy/dig
```

## Usage

Usage is really simple, start with a `map[string]interface{}` and define which
route to follow, take this `testMap` example:

```go
testMap := map[string]interface{}{
	"first": map[string]interface{}{
		"first.1": map[string]string{
			"col.1": "a",
			"col.2": "b",
			"col.3": "c",
		},
	},
	"second": map[string]map[string]string{
		"second.2": map[string]string{
			"col.4": "d",
			"col.5": "e",
			"col.6": "f",
		},
	},
}
```

Suppose you want to get the value of the element with key "col.4". You'll need
a route, the route of a node is defined as the array of map keys needed to be
traversed in order to get to the node, in the above example the route would
be: second > second.2 > col.4, in that specific order.

Now suppose you expect "col.4" to be a string, then you'd use `dig.String()` to
get the value.

```go
// s = "d"
s := dig.String(&testMap, "second", "second.2", "col.4")
```

Note that you're passing a pointer to map (`&testMap`) instead of a map.

There are more sugar methods with similar functionality, such as
`dig.Uint64()`, `dig.Float64()`, `dig.Interface()`, etc. all these methods will
attempt to convert the node data type into the expected Go type.

The `dig.String()` function and friends are just wrappers around `dig.Get()`,
and you can also use `dig.Get()` to get a node value, it will also produce an
`error` value if something goes wrong.

```go
var s string
err := dig.Get(&testMap, &s, "second", "second.2", "col.4")
```

Now suppose you'd like to set the value of "col.5", you'd use the `dig.Set()`
function:

```go
dig.Set(&testMap, "modified", "second", "second.2", "col.4")
```

And finally, if you're ever in the need of creating a route on a map, you could
use `dig.Dig()` like this:

```go
var i int

m := map[string]interface{}{}

// Create a path.
dig.Dig(&m, "foo", "bar", "baz")

// Set the value 42.
dig.Set(&m, 42, "foo", "bar", "baz")

// Get the value, expecting 42.
dig.Get(&m, &i, "foo", "bar", "baz")

if i != 42 {
	t.Errorf("Test failed.")
}
```

methods.
